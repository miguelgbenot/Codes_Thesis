To achieve the outcomes showcased in the Master's thesis, acquire the foundational code from Leonard Werneck's GitHub repository at https://github.com/leowerneck/SFcollapse1D. The instructions to compile the code are explained in his GitHub repository. In the present file the modified version of that presented code can be found in SFCollapse1D_modified. To obtain the numerical results presented in the thesis, follow these steps: download the file, extract its contents, and enter 'make' in the terminal to create an executable file. To generate the same numerical results as presented, input './runscript.sh' in the terminal, and the code will be executed using the identical constants.


In the file Computing_quantities.ipynb is located  the python script used to generate all of the graph displayed in the Thesis and to do the data analysis. Once the results obtained after running the SFcollapse1D are obtained, one just have to execute the python scrip in the same folder where the outcome of the simulations are stored. 

The Python script 'constant finder' serves as a highly valuable tool for determining the critical constant for individual scalar fields. Users can input a known value, causing the collapse of the scalar field (which can be set as high as needed), along with a lower threshold where the field disperses. By specifying the number of simulations, the code generates a text file containing the constant values used in each simulation, alongside information indicating whether the scalar field disperses or not.
To pinpoint the most precise critical constant, users should focus on the final lines where the transition occurs from a weak to a strong regime (or vice versa). The critical constant is then determined to lie between these two valu
